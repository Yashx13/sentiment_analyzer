R0207,P005,Neither great nor terrible. The Keystone performs as advertised. Delivery was fast and packaging was neat.,2
R0208,P006,The earbuds stopped working properly after a few days. One side just went silent while the other started producing a weird static noise. Really poor quality and not worth the money.,1
R0209,P006,"I had high hopes for these, but the sound keeps cutting out every few minutes. The connection is unstable and the audio lags when watching videos. Very disappointing experience overall.",1
R0210,P006,"The charging case feels cheap and fragile. After a week of use, the lid doesn’t close properly anymore. Wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone.",4
R0211,P006,One earbud died completely after just two uses. Tried all the troubleshooting steps but nothing worked. Waste of money.,4
R0212,P006,These earbuds constantly disconnect even when my phone is right next to me. The Bluetooth connection is extremely unreliable.,3
R0213,P006,Sound quality is below average with no bass at all. Feels like listening through a tin can. Expected better from something advertised as premium.,4
R0214,P006,The battery lasts barely two hours on a full charge. Totally unacceptable for the price point.,2
R0215,P006,"Uncomfortable fit, hurts my ears after a short time. Tried all the ear tips provided but none made a difference.",2
R0216,P006,Touch controls are overly sensitive and keep pausing or skipping songs whenever I adjust them. Really frustrating to use.,2
R0217,P006,Noise cancellation is practically non-existent. I can hear every sound around me even at high volume.,3
R0218,P006,The microphone quality is terrible. People on calls keep saying I sound muffled or far away.,2
R0219,P006,"After a few weeks, they refuse to pair automatically. I have to reconnect manually every single time.",2
R0220,P006,One of the earbuds randomly disconnects and doesn’t reconnect until I reset the whole device. Annoying and time-consuming.,2
R0221,P006,The charging case stopped working within a month. The earbuds don’t charge anymore and customer support is useless.,2
R0222,P006,Audio is out of sync when watching videos. There’s always a delay between what I see and hear.,2
R0223,P006,The earbuds arrived with scratches and dust on them. Seems like a used or refurbished item sold as new.,4
R0224,P006,Left earbud volume is noticeably lower than the right. Makes listening uncomfortable and unbalanced.,2
R0225,P006,They keep falling out no matter what tips I use. Definitely not suitable for workouts or even walking.,4
R0226,P006,Battery indicator is inaccurate. It shows 80% and then suddenly shuts down. Very misleading.,2
R0227,P006,The plastic build feels cheap and flimsy. Doesn’t justify the cost at all.,3
R0228,P006,The charging cable stopped working after two days. Had to buy a new one just to keep using the case.,2
R0229,P006,Sometimes the audio just stops for no reason and resumes a few seconds later. Completely ruins the listening experience.,1
R0230,P006,Advertised as noise-cancelling but it does absolutely nothing. Even budget earphones do better.,4
R0231,P006,"Case LEDs don’t light up properly, so I can’t tell if it’s charging or not.",3
R0232,P006,The earbuds overheat after a few minutes of playback. Not safe to use for long sessions.,2
R0233,P006,Poorly designed touch controls that make it difficult to use without triggering random actions.,2
R0234,P006,The right earbud doesn’t fit in the charging slot properly. It just sits loose and doesn’t charge half the time.,3
R0235,P006,They automatically disconnect if I open another app. Very unstable Bluetooth performance.,2
R0236,P006,There’s a constant low hum in the background during playback. Super annoying after a while.,3
R0237,P006,Sound gets distorted at even medium volume. Not enjoyable at all for music.,1
R0238,P006,Packaging was poorly done and the box was damaged when it arrived.,2
R0239,P006,I regret buying these. Should’ve read the reviews before wasting money on such low quality.,1
R0240,P006,Charging takes forever and doesn’t last long once unplugged. Terrible battery management.,2
R0242,P006,Decent for calls but not for music. The sound feels flat and uninspired.,3
R0246,P006,Looks stylish and lightweight but doesn’t live up to performance expectations.,3
R0241,P006,"The earbuds are okay for basic listening, but the audio lacks clarity. For the price, there are better options available.",5
R0248,P006,"Usable for casual use, but I wouldn’t recommend for serious listeners.",4
R0249,P007,"Very Very good",5
